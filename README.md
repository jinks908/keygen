# keygen
Random passkey generator

An elementary passkey generator with character options (ascii letters, integers, and special charset). Can run in any python interpreter or just directly from a terminal (i.e. 'python keygen.py'). Considering coverting this to a module that can be imported for user DBs for random user passkey generation. Depends on how much coffee I have left tonight.
